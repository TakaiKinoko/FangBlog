During each pass, the threads that follow the other path are not allowed to take effect.</p>\n<p>These passes are <em>sequential</em> to each other, thus they will add to the execution time.</p>\n<h4>multipass aproach &#x26; divergence</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The <strong>multipass approach</strong> to <strong>divergent warp execution</strong> extends the SIMD hardware‚Äôs ability to implement the full semantics of CUDA threads. While the hardware executes the same instruction for all threads in a warp, it selectively lets the threads take effect in each pass only, allowing every thread to take its own control flow path. This preserves the independence of threads while taking advantage of the reduced cost of SIMD hardware.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When threads <em>in the same warp</em> follow different paths of control flow, we say that these threads <strong>diverge</strong> in their execution.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>if-else example</h4>\n<p>In the if-else example, divergence arises if some threads in a warp take the then path and some the else path. The cost of divergence is the <em>extra pass</em> the hardware needs to take to allow the threads in a warp to make their own decisions.</p>\n<h4>for-loop example</h4>\n<p>If threads in a warp execute a for loop that can iterate <strong>six, seven, or eight</strong> times for different threads:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All threads will finish the first six iterations together.</li>\n<li>Two passes will be used to execute the seventh iteration, one for those that take the iteration and one for those that do not.</li>\n<li>Two passes will be used to execute the eighth iteration, one for those that take the iteration and one for those that do not.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>other scenarios</h4>\n<p>In terms of source statements, a control construct can result in thread divergence when its decision condition is based on threadIdx values.</p>\n<p>For example, the statement <code class=\"language-text\">if (threadIdx.x. &gt; 2) {}</code> causes the threads to follow two divergent control flow paths. Threads 0, 1, and 2 follow a different path than threads 3, 4, 5, etc.</p>\n<p>Similarly, a loop can cause thread divergence if its loop condition is based on thread index values.</p>"
