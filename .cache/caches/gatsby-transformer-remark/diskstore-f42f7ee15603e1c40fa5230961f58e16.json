  "val": "<p>In <a href=\"/cuda2-warp\">The CUDA Parallel Programming Model - 2. Warps</a>, I briefly talked about how CUDA processors hide long-latency operations such as global memory accesses by through their warp-scheduling mechanism. </p>\n<p>Assume that a CUDA device allows up to 8 blocks and 1024 threads per SM, whichever becomes a limitation first. Furthermore, it allows up to 512 threads in each block. For image blur, should we use 8 ×8, 16 ×16, or 32 ×32 thread blocks? To answer the question, we can analyze the pros and cons of each choice. If we use 8 ×8 blocks, each block would have only 64 threads. We will need 1024/64 =12 blocks to fully occupy an SM. However, each SM can only allow up to 8 blocks; thus, we will end up with only 64 ×8 =512 threads in each SM. This limited number implies that the SM execution resources will likely be underutilized because fewer warps will be available to schedule around long-latency operations.</p>\n<p>The 16 ×16 blocks result in 256 threads per block, implying that each SM can take 1024/256 =4 blocks. This number is within the 8-block limitation and is a good configuration as it will allow us a full thread capacity in each SM and a maximal number of warps for scheduling around the long-latency operations. The 32 ×32 blocks would give 1024 threads in each block, which exceeds the 512 threads per block limitation of this device. Only 16 ×16 blocks allow a maximal number of threads assigned to each SM.</p>"
