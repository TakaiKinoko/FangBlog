  "val": "<p>The <strong>compute-to-global-memory-access</strong> ratio has major implications on the performance of a CUDA kernel. Programs whose execution speed is limited by memory access throughput as memory-bound programs.</p>\n<h2>Memory as a Limiting Factor to Parallelism</h2>\n<h3>the more the thread requires, the fewer that can cohabit</h3>\n<p>While CUDA registers and shared memory can be extremely effective in reducing the number of accesses to global memory, one must be careful to stay within the capacity of these memories. These memories are forms of resources necessary for thread execution. Each CUDA device offers limited resources, thereby <strong>limiting the number of threads that can simultaneously reside in the SM for a given application</strong>. In general, <strong>the more resources each thread requires, the fewer the threads that can reside in each SM, and likewise, the fewer the threads that can run in parallel in the entire device</strong>.</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<p>To illustrate the interaction between register usage of a kernel and the level of parallelism that a device can support, assume that in a current-generation device D, each SM can accommodate up to 1536 threads and 16,384 registers. While 16,384 is a large number, each thread is only allowed to use a very limited number of registers, considering the number of threads that can reside in each SM. To support 1536 threads, each thread can use only 16,384/1536 =10 registers. If each thread uses 11 registers, the number of threads that can be executed concurrently in each SM will be reduced. Such reduction occurs at the block granularity; e.g., if each block contains 512 threads, the reduction of threads will be accomplished by reducing 512 threads at a time. Thus, the next smaller number of threads from 1536 will be 1024, indicating a 1/3 reduction of threads that can simultaneously reside in each SM. This procedure can substantially reduce the number of warps available for scheduling, thereby decreasing the ability of the processor to find useful work in the presence of long-latency operations.</p>\n<h2>Memory Parallism</h2>\n<p>DRAM bursting alone is not sufficient to realize the level of DRAM access bandwidth required by modern processors. In this post, I’ll talk more about how to achieve better memory parallelism.</p>\n<h2>Forms of Parallel Organization</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>banks</li>\n<li>channels</li>\n</ul>\n<p><figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 590px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/46b5fc4fac4cc0c278e6734391a3089d/7e3f6/channel%26banks.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 43.699999999999996%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Channel and banks\"\n        title=\"Channel and banks\"\n        src=\"/static/46b5fc4fac4cc0c278e6734391a3089d/88218/channel%26banks.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/46b5fc4fac4cc0c278e6734391a3089d/7237a/channel%26banks.jpg 148w,\n/static/46b5fc4fac4cc0c278e6734391a3089d/0cfdf/channel%26banks.jpg 295w,\n/static/46b5fc4fac4cc0c278e6734391a3089d/88218/channel%26banks.jpg 590w,\n/static/46b5fc4fac4cc0c278e6734391a3089d/77d57/channel%26banks.jpg 885w,\n/static/46b5fc4fac4cc0c278e6734391a3089d/7e3f6/channel%26banks.jpg 1000w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span>\n    <figcaption class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figcaption\">Channel and banks</figcaption>\n  </figure></p>\n<ul>\n<li>A processor contains one or more channels.</li>\n<li>Each channel is a <strong>memory controller</strong> with a <strong>bus</strong> that connects a set of <strong>DRAM banks</strong> to the processor.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bus</h3>\n<p>The data transfer bandwidth of a bus is defined by its <em>width</em> and <em>clock frequency</em>.</p>\n<p>Modern double data rate (DDR) busses perform two data transfers per clock cycle:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>one at the rising edge of each clock cycle</li>\n<li>one at the falling edge of each clock cycle</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>is DDR enough?</h4>\n<p>For example, a 64-bit DDR bus with a clock frequency of 1 GHz has a bandwidth of <code class=\"language-text\">8B*2*1 GHz =16 GB/sec</code>.
