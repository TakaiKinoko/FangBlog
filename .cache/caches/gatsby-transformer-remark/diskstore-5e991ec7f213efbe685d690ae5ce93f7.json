Memory Coalescing</a>), I put up a note on the effect of memory alignment on memory coalesce. Here I feel necessary to add a little bit more. </p>\n<p>Memory access on the GPU works much better if the data items are aligned. Hence, allocating 2D or 3D arrays so that every row starts at a 64-byte or 128-byte boundary address will imporve performance. </p>"
