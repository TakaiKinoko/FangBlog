  "val": "<p>In the fifth post of the CUDA series (<a href=\"/cuda5-coalesce\">The CUDA Parallel Programming Model - 5. Memory Coalescing</a>), I put up a note on the effect of memory alignment on memory coalesce. Here I feel necessary to add a little bit more. </p>\n<p>Memory access on the GPU works much better if the data items are aligned. Hence, allocating 2D or 3D arrays so that every row starts at a 64-byte or 128-byte boundary</p>"
