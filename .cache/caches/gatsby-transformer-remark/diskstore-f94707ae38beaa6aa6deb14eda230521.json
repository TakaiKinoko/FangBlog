  "val": "<p>In the fifth post of the CUDA series (<a href=\"/cuda5-coalesce\">The CUDA Parallel Programming Model - 5. Memory Coalescing</a>), I put up a note on the effect of memory alignment on memory coalesce. Here I feel necessary to add a little bit more. </p>\n<p>Memory access on the GPU works much better if the data items are aligned. Hence, allocating 2D or 3D arrays so that every row starts at a 64-byte or 128-byte boundary address will imporve performance. However, this is hard to do for programmers.</p>\n<p>Donâ€™t worry, CUDA offers special memory operations that take care of alignment for us. </p>\n<h2>cudaMallocPitch()</h2>\n<h2>cudaMemcpy2D()</h2>"
